{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node server.js",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### nixpacks.toml
```toml

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### Test Health Check
```bash
# Using curl
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "Video Downloader Backend is running!",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "ytDlpInstalled": true,
  "supportedPlatforms": ["YouTube", "Instagram"]
}
```

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Test root endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/

# Test video info endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/video/info \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"}'
```

---

## üì± Update Flutter App

### Update API URLs
Replace the URLs in your Flutter app:

```dart
// In reels_tab.dart
Uri.parse('https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/download/instagram')

// In shorts_tab.dart  
Uri.parse('https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/download/youtube')
```

### Test Connection
```bash
# Test from your local machine
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/health
```

---

## üìä Monitoring and Management

### CLI Commands
```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# View logs with follow
railway logs --follow

# Check status
railway status

# Restart service
railway service restart

# Open in browser
railway open

# View variables
railway variables

# Set variable
railway variables set KEY=VALUE
```

### Web Dashboard Features
1. **Deployments**: View deployment history and logs
2. **Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
3. **Logs**: Real-time log viewing
4. **Variables**: Manage environment variables
5. **Domains**: Configure custom domains

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Build fails**
```bash
# Check build logs in Railway dashboard
# Common causes:
# - Missing dependencies in package.json
# - Python/yt-dlp installation issues
# - Node.js version incompatibility
```

**Issue: yt-dlp not found**
```bash
# Check if yt-dlp is installed in build logs
# Verify nixpacks.toml configuration
# Wait for build to complete (can take 5-10 minutes)
```

**Issue: Port binding errors**
```bash
# Railway automatically sets PORT environment variable
# Your server.js already handles this correctly
# Check if PORT is being used correctly
```

**Issue: CORS errors**
```bash
# Your server already has CORS configured
# Check if frontend is using correct domain
# Verify HTTPS vs HTTP
```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Railway status
railway status

# View detailed logs
railway logs --follow

# Check environment variables
railway variables

# Restart service
railway service restart
```

---

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

### Auto-Deploy Setup
1. **GitHub Integration**: Railway automatically deploys when you push to GitHub
2. **Branch Protection**: Set up branch protection rules for production
3. **Environment Variables**: Configure different variables for different environments

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Deploy manually
railway up

# Deploy specific branch
railway up --branch develop
```
